# Preface{-}  
Salt-affected soils such as saline or sodic soils are distributed in all continents at various levels of problem intensity.
They are soils with high amounts of soluble salts and/or sodium ions. An updated information of their distribution
and drivers is a first step towards their sustainable management. This book provides technical guidelines and
approach for developing a harmonized multiscale soil information of salt-affected soils. The book is organized into
three sections covering seven chapters. The sections are sequentially arranged but independently designed to
benefit focused readership who may want to go straight to any section. Section 1 givesthe background information.
It has three chapters covering existing literature on the characteristics and mapping methods for salt problems in
the soil. It is intended to illustrate the basic concepts, linkage of the characteristics of salt-affected soils with input
data requirements for their mapping, existing classification methods, and global distribution of these soils. Section
2 covers the methodological procedures for developing multiscale spatial information of salt-affected soils. It has
two chapters describing requirements, input data preparation, and the procedural steps for developing spatial
information of salt-affected soils. It outlines how data from different sources and characteristics are harmonized
and integrated to produce information of salt-affected soils. Section 3 covers information sharing and resources
mobilization when developing information on salt-affected soils. It gives the guidelines for preparing spatial maps
and steps for value-addition to benefit end-users of the information. It also contains a generic training program for
building technical capacity for mapping salt-affected soils. This program also serves as one of the steps for
harmonizing product development in multiscale mapping activities.  

# Acknowledgements{-}  
The data used in this manual came from various sources. The Government of Sudan through the
Agriculture Research Centre (ARC) in Wad Madani, authorized the use of their soil data and some
covariates. Remote sensing images and elevation data were downloaded from the United States
Geological Survey website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). We received technical and financial support
from Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) through Global Soil Partnership (GSP).

# Executive Summary{-}
## Background{-}
Salt-affected soils are soils with high amounts of soluble salts and/or sodium ions. The first global
distribution of these soils was first estimated in the late 1970s at about 1 billion hectares. Since then,
there has been inconsistent updates of the global distribution. Recent literature at the globalscale mostly
use data that was collected in the late 1970s and still portray global distribution of affected areas at about
1 billion hectares. Evidently, a new update is necessary to improve knowledge of the status and actual
distribution of salt-affected soils. Part of the reason for the inconsistent global update is due to unclear
coordination for periodic data collection and harmonized data collection protocols to support it. The
Global Soil Partnership (GSP) of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is leading global
mobilization to kickstart information update from the country to global level. The GPS's bottom-up
approach is underpinned by the twin need to support countries to update their national information and
to contribute to the update of global information of salt-affected soils. One of the challenges with this
approach is the potential uncertainties due to differences in datasets and approaches by countries. The
focus of this book is to provide guidelines for harmonizing input data and approaches for mapping saltaffected soils at all levels of information update.
Developing spatial information of salt-affected soils
Many methods exist in the literature for mapping salt-affected soils. They include methods based on soiltype mapsintegrated with expert opinions, remote sensing applications and soil indicator-based method.
The requirements, limitations and example applications of these methods have been highlighted in this
book. Prominence has been given to the indicator-based approach for mapping salt-affected soils
because 1) the method is amenable to country-level harmonization of procedures, 2) it develops
information of both salt-affected soils and soil properties related to salt problems, 3) the method is able
to quantify mapping accuracy and uncertainty, 4) quantifies horizontal and vertical information. The
description of its methodological steps has been illustrated using case-study test data from Northern
Sudan and minimum requirement for input data, computer, and software. The intention is to present the
steps as clearly and repeatable as possible to enable implementation with own datasets.

## Resource mobilization{-}
Developing information and updating the status of salt-affected soils is resource-intensive and should be
properly planned. This book has dedicated the last two chapters for resources mobilization to build
national information on salt-affected soils. It outlines key areas of focus for resource mobilization and
steps for building technical resources to develop a harmonized database for assessing salt-affected soils.
It also discusses steps for enriching spatial maps through value addition to improve their information
resource.

# SECTION ONE - BACKGROUND INFORMATION{-}   
This section gives the background information related to the global mobilization to provide mapping of
salt-affected soils. It also covers a brief literature review on the characteristics, distribution, indicators and
drivers, and mapping and classification methods for these soils. The section is intended to illustrate the
relationship between the characteristics of these soils and input data requirement for their mapping and
classification.
